### Grav Course Hub is an open source project intended to help tech-savvy instructors enhance the learning experience for their students by providing multi-device delivery and a collaborative workflow not present in their current Learning Management System (LMS). As an open platform under the full control of the instructor, a broader choice of online course components can be integrated into the Course Hub to help reach unmet pedagogical goals.

Built with the modern flat-file CMS Grav ([https://getgrav.org/](https://getgrav.org/)), the multi-device ready Grav Course Hub can partner with your existing LMS, where it serves as an alternative and customizable front-end to any required LMS elements for your students. With this approach, instructors have the freedom to move beyond the confines of the LMS while sensitive student data remains located within your institutional or organizationâ€™s LMS.

Content in Grav is stored and maintained as individual files rather than inside a database, so services such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) (which can be hosted on your own server) can be easily partnered with your Course Hub for open collaboration and version control. Being file-based also means that instructors have their choice of tools for editing their Course Hub content, and site updates can be performed in as little as one button press.

Explore an example **single** course site at [demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub/](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub/) and a **multiple** course site at [demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-multi-course-hub/](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-multi-course-hub/)._

### Course Hub Highlights
* A complete ready-to-run Grav package (open source)
* Blog-format, with 'featured' (sticky) posts
* [Single course](http://hibbittsdesign.org/demo/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/) per Hub, [multiple courses](http://hibbittsdesign.org/demo/grav-multi-course-blog-hub/) per Hub or even [multiple course sub-sites](http://hibbittsdesign.org/demo/grav-multi-course-pages-hub/) (blog + multiple pages per course) per Hub
* Optional important reminders & class preparations areas
* Hub pages can be easily added/removed/changed
* Uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for streamlined cross-platform content
* Image header area above Hub navigation bar
* Sidebar is a simple markdown file, which can also contain HTML
* URL flag to only display page content (for display within LMS). For example, [http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/home/week-03/onlydisplaypagecontent:true](http://demo.hibbittsdesign.org/grav-course-hub-bootstrap/home/week-03/onlydisplaypagecontent:true)
* External links are automatically opened in a new Tab/Window
* Built-in support for Hub (content pages _and_ theme customizations) to be collaboratively maintained on GitHub, GitLab or any other Git service which supports Webhooks
* Since everything is built with Grav it can be _entirely_ customized

### Git Sync Configuration
On the far-right of your site menubar there will be a reminder displayed to complete the two steps to enable GitHub/GitLab syncing and editing of your site content.
